### Overview
This is a data visualization tool for statisticians to visualize the availability of statistical data under the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/) indicators by country and indicator. The availability of data is determined by the number of years for which data has been collected for a particular indicator and a specific country. Use this tool to get a sense of how much and how often data is collected and provided by countries.

The [View by Indicator](https://d2rwhfbjpjbl50.cloudfront.net/indicator.html) tool provides a quick overview of data availability across countries when viewed by Goal/Target/Indicator. The [View by Region](https://d2rwhfbjpjbl50.cloudfront.net/region.html) tool provides a more detailed view of availability by region as well as a specific country. Select a region and specific country to find out how much data is available over the Goal/Target/Indicator/Series, and click on the Series to access the data that is available for that Series.

### Design
This tool has been created using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. The [d3.js library](https://d3js.org/) was used to create the visualizations. This tool is meant to be incorporated into the [SDG website](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/).
